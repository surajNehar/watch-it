This is a video streaming app built using React with an emphasis on modern web development practices. The app utilizes React hooks and state management for efficient and scalable code. Redux Toolkit is employed for global state management, Axios is used to fetch data from a Rest API, and React Router DOM Version 6 is used for navigation. Additionally, custom hooks are created, and features like a custom carousel/slider and infinite scrolling are implemented without relying on external libraries. The app also includes loading skeletons during API requests, proper error handling, a 404 forbidden page, and responsive layouts with carefully crafted media queries.
